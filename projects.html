      <h2>Logic Games Solver</h2>
      <p>I coded an app to solve logic games automatically. For Sudokus, you can flash the puzzle like a QR code to solve it. I also implemented Kakuro, Slitherlink, Futoshiki and Bridges. The app is no longer on the play store, but you can download the apk <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onk4clFiYO3cu0iRyt5pd2gEzAEOgatE/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>. This app won an honorable mention (highest rank) in the CP app competition at the CP conference in 2022.</p>

      <h2>Third Life</h2>
      <p>This is the first full game I developped. It is a cat life simulator, and a tribute to my late cat. I had so many more ideas, but I like it as it is now. To play it, you can download it <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qI4xG2EyAeHTPi6oZpj8lANLsvYMiJ-4?usp=drive_link">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Rythm JRPG</h2>
      <p>This is my second game. I wanted to implement a rythm game because it is a style that I really like. Again, it is not finished, and this is only a simple little game. You should be able to play it online at <a href="https://tiouz.itch.io/rythm-jrpg">itch.io</a>. However, it seems that there is a bug with the export.</p>
